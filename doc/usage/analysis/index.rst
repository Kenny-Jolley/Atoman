Analysis
========

Analysis is performed using "Analysis pipelines".  Within an analysis pipeline you can add lists of filters/calculators.  
Each list runs independently of the others, starting from the selected input lattice. Within a list, multiple 
filters/calculators can be added.  Available property calculators/filters are listed below.
