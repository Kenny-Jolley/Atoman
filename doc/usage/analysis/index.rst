Analysis is performed using an "Analysis pipeline", found on the "Analysis toolbar" on the left of the application (see right).  
Multiple pipelines can be configured at once.  A pipeline is viewed in a renderer window. An individual pipeline 
takes a reference and an input system as its input and contains the following sections:
