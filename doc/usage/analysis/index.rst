Analysis
========

Analysis is performed using an "Analysis pipeline", found in the main dock widget on the left of the application.  
Multiple pipelines can be configured at once.  A pipeline is viewed in a renderer window. An individual pipeline 
takes a reference and an input system as its input and contains the following sections:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    
    filter_list
